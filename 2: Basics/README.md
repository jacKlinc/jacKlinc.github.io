# Learning Web Development

## 1: Review of high-level 
This section is to remind me of the general process of request-response process,
what protocols are used, and how the backend talks to the user.


## 2: Basics
HTML, CSS & JavaScript are the fundamental languages of frontend development and
will need to be learned.  
Approach:
A: Build a basic HTML website
B: Style it with CSS
C: Add JS for user input

Before each step, a tutorial is followed.

## 3: Website Types
There is more than one way to build a website, three major options:

A: Dynamic - generated by the server
B: Single Page - One HTML page with JS doing the work
C: Static - Basic, old but still used extensively

Each have pros and cons.  There wll be a focus on React due to its popularity. 

## 4: Learn JS Framework
Modern frontend development is done with a JS framework.  The plan is to learn 
the basics of one framework and then create a single page website for a portfolio.
 When completed the same website could be made again in a different framework.

## 5: Server-side Language
How the client communicates with web services and databases.  This is brings 
front and backend together so a web application can be made.  I'll use Node 
as it will be easier after previous sections.

## 6: Revise Basics
Go into more depth with each language/framework.  One example would be learning
SASS instead of vanilla CSS or using AJAx to learn how pages update HTML 
without changing the URL.
