        <p>There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. 
            Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience... the web. 
            If you proceed from the notion that every person engages with the web would 
            prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the 
            web would prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job. Companies of course 
            know this, so they gire Web Developers to ensure their sites provide great 
            experiences. So, lots of websites and lots of users means lots of demand. LOTS 
            of demand.
